description = This unit is designed to allow easy mating of the KSF AdvSRB "B" size to the "Rockomax" size standard. It has a built in decoupler and retrorockets, to facilitate trouble-free decoupling events. Also, new for 2013, there are hard points located around the uppermost portion to attach struts to payloads.
